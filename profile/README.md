# 🎓 Academic Context

These projects reflect practical implementation of:

- Algorithmic problem solving  
- Data structures  
- Memory management  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Systems-level development  

Developed as part of coursework and independent academic practice during my Computer Science degree at HUJI.
